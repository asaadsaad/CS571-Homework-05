# CS571 Homework 05

## React Native Tabata Timer
Using Snack, build a React Native application for Tabata Timer, the workout consists of 10 sets for 5 mins. Every set consists of 20 secs workout and 10 secs rest.
The application will display a "Start" button, once clicked, you will alternate a green background with a decrementing 20 secs timer in the center, followed by a decrementing 10 secs timer with a red background. When a total of 10 sets is finished, reset the app to the initial state.  
During workout, users should be able to "stop" the timer and go back to initial state.  
Export your Snack and add to your homework directory.

## Install Expo CLI
Follow the React Native getting started guide and install Expo CLI on your machine. Make sure you can see the app on a Simulator or on your phone with Expo Client.
