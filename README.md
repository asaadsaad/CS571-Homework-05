## React Native Tabata Timer
Build a React Native application for Tabata Timer, the workout consists of 10 sets for 5 mins. Every set consists of 20 secs workout and 10 secs rest.
The application will display a "Start" button, once clicked, you will alternate a green background with a decrementing 20 secs timer in the center, followed by a decrementing 10 secs timer with a red background. When a total of 10 sets is finished, reset the app to the initial state.  
During workout, users should be able to "stop" the timer and go back to initial state.
