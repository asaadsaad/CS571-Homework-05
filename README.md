## React Native Tabata Timer
Build a React Native application for Tabata Timer, the workout consists of 10 sets. Every cycle is 20 secs workout and 10 secs rest. This is a 5 mins workout.  
The application will display a "Start" button, once clicked, you will alternate a green background with decrementing 20 secs timer in the center, followed by decrementing 10 secs timer with a red background. When a total of 10 sets is finished, reset the app to the initial state. During workout, users should be able to "stop" the timer and go back to initial state.
